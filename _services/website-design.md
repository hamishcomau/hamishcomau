Website Design Burnie

Web Design and Development


We like to make all interactions positive and build long-lasting client relationships. Hamish provides ongoing professional development support and digital marketing experience. Experts in sticking to your budget and design brief, whilst nailing the key requirements.

Buy and Sell Online
eCommerce website design is not just how a site looks, but also how it works, both aspects crucial to how well visitors are converted into customers. Hamish caters to all industries and markets, sell more and increase your bottom line.

Content Management Systems
CMS websites are database driven applications with extensible admin dashboards, giving you the power to add or edit content and features. Hamish helps to select the most appropriate platform, or works with your existing CMS.

Custom Web Applications
Hamish can work with most popular frameworks to develop or extend your custom web application. Whilst we have our preference in Django, Rails, and Laravel, our Tasmanian developers can support or build your application.

Professional Web Design
Our developers are with you for the full website design process, from inception to post-development support. With first-class knowledge and extensive experience, it's easy to see why Hamish is leading the way for web design in Burnie.

Your website is the most important aspect of your digital marketing, due to visitor traffic converting browsers into paying customers. We design websites with the primary goal of better traffic conversion, turning leads into sales and increasing your levels of growth.

## Website Design and Development
Spend a few minutes reviewing our website design portfolio, a small example of the hundreds of sites designed and developed by Hamish. We develop websites to ensure long term support and project viability. Located in Burnie, Tasmania, we are a full service studio providing a range of digital and development skills.

### Why isn't ongoing support or changes free of charge?
Whilst we would love to be able to offer support or updates as a freebie, it simply wouldn't be possible if we want to continue employing the best developers possible. Saving money now by using an inferior service provider will cost more over time. Hamish offers a high level of service, but if you would like to save a few dollars, we provide full admin login details to perform your own updates and content revisions.

### We must have this feature on our website. How do I do this to my project?
We are a happy and helpful bunch, but unfortunately we have our limits when it comes to providing advice or consulting services. If you would like to get our expertise or thoughts, we are more than happy and prepared to help at an hourly or agreed rate. Hit us up for a coffee to discuss your plans or get recommendations.

### Your competitor offers the same stuff for cheaper, how is that possible?
If money is the only metric that matters, we might not be a good fit, although our pricing is excellent for the level of service and expertise we provide. Price and value are different measurements, our team knows what they are doing, and adds value to your project.

### How much does a website cost?
Website design and development varies greatly depending on things such as frameworks or platforms used, external data APIs that need to be integrated, size and scope of the website, revision and management requirements, and custom specialised functionality. Custom web apps require proper planning and road-mapping to ensure a successful build.

### How long does it take to design and build a website?
Generally the time it takes to produce a website depends on a few variables. The most common CMS or eCommerce powered website normally takes around 4 to 6 weeks to design and code, sometimes longer if our graphic designers need to prototype multiple layouts or revision requests. Custom web apps and specific frameworks generally take longer.

### Do you develop Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android apps?
The straightforward answer is no, not at this time. Although we are experienced with tools like Electron, we don't offer this type of service. We do make our websites work on all devices and resolutions, developing a native iOS or Android app is a specialised task. Talk to us for recommendations on who can build your mobile app.

### We have an existing piece of software or tool, can you make our website talk to that?
Yes, however it depends on the software or tool or API to determine how long it will take and how much it will cost. Most good providers have an API we can consume, to either display information or complete specific tasks from your own site. We are vastly experienced with the Rezdy Agent and Supplier, Expedia, Stripe and PayPal, SoundCloud, MailChimp, and more APIs.

### Do you write the content for my site?
Website design estimates exclude content creation and copy-writing. It is up to you, the client, to provide suitable content before the launch of your site or project. However, we are happy to provide an additional quote for our professional (and published author) writer to create content that can help your site be found in all major search engines.
