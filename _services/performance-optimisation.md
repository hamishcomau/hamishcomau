## Optimisation Process

Our optimisation process has been streamlined, making your website more attractive to ranking algorithms and data structures.

Then we implement changes to code, server/hosting, and onsite content structure strategies to push your site higher.

#### Do I need to sign a contract or minimum term?
You are not committed to any monthly or annual contract. Performance optimisation is a one-time task, that might need to be done at regular intervals depending on changes to your website and hosting infrastructure.

#### Is there a set up fee to optimise my website performance?
We currently charge a setup fee, optimising site performance to a high level requires a significant amount of research and expertise. Hamish will track analytics and organic keyword rankings in Google and Bing for 3-6 months to gauge the performance optimisation success, and further refine changes as required.

#### How long does it take to research and optimise my site?
Under normal circumstances it can take up to 2 weeks to research and track key site metrics, then implement changes to code, content, and server/hosting. It can take longer if your website contains adult or questionable content, a custom [content management system](/services/content-management-systems/), or if your target market has strong competitors.

#### Can I limit my spend or budget?
Website performance optimisation is not an ongoing or recurring expense, we will work on optimising a site until it achieves acceptable benchmark results. Expenditure can be reduced by not tracking keyword rankings in search engines or recording visitor analytics, but then it becomes much harder to gauge the success of site optimisation and what might need to be improved in future.

#### What keywords should I choose to target?
Keyword selection is absolutely critical, and a large part of the initial research process. If you want to succeed with website performance optimisation, you should only choose keywords that your audience use to find your business, products, or services. Hamish finds relevant keywords using a planning tool, as well as complementary services such as analytics or traffic logs.

#### How do I increase the position of my website in search results?
If your website is not displaying in search results frequently, it can be because of two main causes. The first is your competitor saturation, if you are in a populated market or demographic it can take a lot longer to achieve acceptable results. The second is your website could have a low quality score, which is determined by the relevance of your website content and the quality of your landing page.

#### What is the difference between organic and paid results?
Organic search engine rankings are the results that appear in search engines naturally, free of charge, determined by the search providers ranking algorithm. Website performance optimisation targets your content structure, site speed, and SEO metrics to help improve these rankings. Paid search results appear at the top or side of a page, such as an Adwords campaign.

#### How long does it take to see results from performance optimisation or content updates?
Large sites that are established and indexed frequently can see results within days. During our own testing and monitoring, we have seen changes within 14 days, but results can vary. Smaller or new websites will take longer because they get crawled by search engine spiders less frequently. Wait at least a week before checking your rankings after site or content changes. New sites can take much longer to make an impression in search engine rankings, keep this in mind if your domain or website is less than 2 years old.
