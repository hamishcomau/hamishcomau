Hamish offers an extensive digital marketing service, located in our Burnie office.

### Do I need to sign a contract or minimum term?
Whilst we recommend a minimum of 6 months to fully establish, monitor, and tweak your advertising campaign, you are not committed to any monthly or annual contract. You can cancel your digital marketing management and SEO package at anytime. The payments are monthly, and billing will finalise at the end of the current month of service.

### Is there a set up fee to establish my SEO or marketing campaign?
We currently charge a setup fee, normally the value of your monthly plan upfront. Creating digital marketing or SEO campaigns to a high level requires a lot of research and expertise. Well planned and managed campaigns will yield a higher return on investment (ROI) and reduce the advertiser spend.

### How long does it take to research and create my Google AdWords campaign?
Under normal circumstances it can take up to 2 weeks to research and develop an effective advertising campaign. New Adwords advertisements will generally be approved by Google straight away, but can take longer if your website contains adult or questionable content.

### How do I limit my Adwords campaign spend or budget?
For every campaign you can specify a daily limit, along with the approach to keyword bidding best suited for optimal results. For example, it is better to have your advert placed higher than a competitor, so we can change our bidding process to make sure our budget is increased to nullify the competition. Google will stop your ad from showing when your daily budget has been spent.

### What keywords should I choose to target?
Keyword selection is absolutely critical, and a large part of the initial research process. If you want to succeed with Adwords, or SEO for that matter, you should only choose keywords that your audience use to find your business, products, or services. Hamish finds relevant keywords using a planning tool, as well as complementary services such as analytics or traffic logs.

### How do I increase the position of my ad in search results?
If your advert is not displaying frequently, it can be because of two main causes. The first is your keyword bid, because the higher the bid, the more chance of a top 3 advert placement. If you bid less than a competitor, your advert will display lower than others. Alternatively your campaign could have a low quality score, which is determined by the relevance of your ad and the quality of your landing page.

### What is the difference between organic and paid results?
Organic search engine rankings are the results that appear in search engines naturally, free of charge, determined by the search providers ranking algorithm. SEO campaigns optimise things like your content, site speed, internal and outgoing links to help improve these rankings. Paid search results appear at the top or side of a page, such as an Adwords campaign.

### How long does it take to see results from an SEO campaign or content updates?
Large sites that are established and indexed frequently can see results within days. During our own testing and monitoring, we have seen changes within 24-48 hours, but results can vary. Smaller or new websites will take longer because they get crawled by search engine spiders less frequently. Wait at least a week before checking your rankings after site or content changes.
