### WordPress eCommerce and WooCommerce

WordPress is a great option to power your online sales, with the WooCommerce plugin leading the pack. WooCommerce turns any WordPress site into a fully functional ecommerce store within minutes, and out of the box enables payments with configurable shipping options. WooCommerce is very customisable, with official and community created extensions available.

WooCommerce store setup is quick and can either be simple or complex, depending on your services or products, and how you prefer to accept payment and manage freight options. There are alternative methods of transforming your WordPress site into an eCommerce store, alternative plugins are available, and JS carts like Snipcart can be seamlessly integrated to get the most out of your online sales.

### WordPress Hosting and Helpful Tools

[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/signup/?plan=visits-starter&interval=year&kaid=DOXBTNWOLNAX) is a premium managed WordPress website hosting provider, with several Google Cloud locations in Australia. Initially introduced to us by a client, we were very pessimistic about what it was advertising compared to actual capabilities. Make no mistake, Kinsta is the best WordPress hosting currently on the market, it works and it works brilliantly. Kinsta is super-fast, with code deployed to Google Cloud infrastructure in Melbourne (for Tasmanian and Victorian clients), and has some killer development features. Let us know if you would like to migrate your WordPress site to Kinsta, as it is something we can with no interruption to your website or online shop.

[Imagify](https://imagify.io/) and [WP Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/) are, in our opinion, essential WordPress optimisation tools created by wpmedia. Both work seamlessly with the Kinsta caching feature, and reduce the time it takes for a visitor to load your WordPress website. Our preferred WordPress theme framework also works perfectly with these optimisation plugins to get the best out of your WordPress website and WooCommerce store.
