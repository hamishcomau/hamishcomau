## General Services and Company

Hamish has been building websites since 2001, from humble beginnings updating online property listings with an Auckland real estate agency, to managing teams of developers on extensive corporate projects. Delivering high quality and [affordable web design](/services/website-design/), working with small local businesses, the development process is more than just a website to us.

The hamish.com.au studio is a full circle solution providing all the tools you need for success with your website and online sales.

#### You seem new, how can I ensure that I won't get burned?

Hamish.com.au was founded in 2014, developing online solutions for local small business in and around the Launceston region. Hamish got his start coding websites as a contractor for a bespoke high-end real estate agency in 2001, long before listing platforms and [database-driven websites](/services/content-management-systems/) were commonplace. Currently Hamish is located in a Burnie home-office studio, employing two talented developers and a fantastic graphic designer who specialises in website UI/UX.

#### What type of service levels do you offer?

We stand by our attention to detail and rapid responses to [contact requests](/contact/). If you submit a contact or quote form, Hamish will respond within 2 business hours. Hamish is available to discuss your web design requirements via email, phone, live chat, slack, Trello, Discord, or your preferred communication platform. You will be speaking to a senior developer at all times.

#### Are you a good fit for my project?

Sometimes we are not best suited to achieve your desired goals or project specifications. The best way to move forward with your website is to have a chat with us, we value all enquiries - even those that we have to turn away or send to a better suited development studio.

#### I don't have time to invest in my website. Can you create a brief and specifications?

Whilst Hamish is adept at interpreting client requirements into beautiful websites, if you do not have time now, it generally translates to not having time in future. We are happy to work with you, at your location, or meet regularly to relay the current project status. The most successful web design projects are the ones that have strong collaboration and communication.

#### We need to talk with some references before signing up. Can I have a client list?

Due to privacy concerns and signed non-disclose agreements, we are not able to provide direct client contact information at this time.

#### Will your team be able to handle our needs?

Hamish is very experienced and strong knowledge at all stages of the website design process, from billing to delivery. If there are potential roadblocks, we will be upfront and honest about the challenges ahead. We currently have a reliable network of contacts who can step in to solve complications or introduce a different set of skills, should there be the need for a fresh set of eyes.

#### Can you work with a company of our size or multiple levels of management and stakeholders?

The short answer is yes, Hamish can work around or within your internal staff, or operate as an onsite contractor to ensure efficiency and reduce project creep.

#### Why should we pick hamish.com.au over your competitors?

The core of our website design ethos is doing what is best for our clients. We fight for the best result, not the easiest, and can be downright stubborn when it comes to building out the right solution with our years of expertise. Hamish is the best, and most qualified website designer in Tasmania, with the results to prove it.

##### Design and Development Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Opensource code editor by Microsoft, with extensions available for PHP, Python, and SASS/CSS processing. Worthy mentions go to Atom, Pycharm, and PHPstorm - all of which we have used extensively in the past. VSCode is the current flavour of the month, and has been for the last 24+ months.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). What we use to design and prototype website layouts and UI, particularly useful for sending clients designs and demonstrations before coding into a working website. Moved from Invision at the start of 2022 in an effort to consolidate and streamline how our design applications integrate with each other.

- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). Very simple form processing for websites, we use our own frontend code and styling, then send the forms submission action to Formspree for validation and addtional spam filtering. Not always the best solution for a website, but very useful in a lot of static applications such as hosting a Jekyll site on Github Pages.

- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/). Opensource Photoshop alternative for editing images and creating artwork. Works great in partnership with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), which we use for vector illustration like logo and branding design. Worth a try for countries like Australia where Microsoft products are typically 66% more expensive and Adobe products typically 42% more expensive than in the USA.

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Vagrant is a bit of magic we use daily. The easiest way to describe Vagrant is the creation of individual virtual machines, isolating projects to their own containerised space. Nearly every project we take on has a Vagrant environment created, along with deployment scripting, which ensures everyone is working on a website is using identical environment and tools. Similar tools exist (such as Docker) but we have been using Vagrant for a long time now and it just works.

##### Hosting and Domain Name Services

- [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/signup/?plan=visits-starter&interval=year&kaid=DOXBTNWOLNAX). Premium managed WordPress website hosting. Initially introduced to us by a client, we were very pessimistic about what it was advertising compared to actual capabilities. Make no mistake, Kinsta is the best WordPress hosting currently on the market, it works and it works brilliantly. Kinsta is super-fast, with code deployed to Google Cloud infrastructure in Melbourne (for Tasmanian and Victorian clients), and has some killer development features. Let us know if you would like to migrate your WordPress site to Kinsta, as it is something we can with no interruption to your website or online shop.

- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/). Canadian-based domain name registry. Whilst not the "cheapest" out there for domain names, the dashboard is easy to use and domain management is very simple. We switched to Hover in 2022 after experiencing a drop in iwantmyname standards and service levels since their acquisition by CentralNic Group Plc, particularly a success rate of 0% for .au domain name transfers.

- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). At a basic level, CloudFlare is a DNS host, and a very good one at that. To say DNS zones is all they do would be an understatement. CloudFlare has some great features for basic websites, as it is a CDN (content delivery network) and offers crucial services like page rules, SSL certificates, security insights, image optimisation, analytics, redirects, and you can even buy domains.

- [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/2789083). Hosted CMS platform, similar to Squarespace but better for website developers in almost every single metric. Static HTML/CSS/JS can be exported from Webflow to use in custom applications, for example a bespoke WordPress theme, and the editing interface is the best we have experienced. If you have a simple website, chances are we are using Webflow to show it off to the world, or at least create initial frontend prototypes. Webflow is hosted on Amazon AWS with 100+ datacentres worldwide, and includes Fastly CDN asset delivery.

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Website hosting doesn't need to be expensive or have a lot of features. Static website generators, like Jekyll, can deploy code to Github Pages for free hosting which is fast and robust. Commonly used to host portfolios, CV, documentation, blogs, and simple websites. The downside is that you need to be experienced with GIT and the command line to create a Jekyll project and push it to your Github Repository. Once you get past the technical hurdles, Github Pages is a solid alternative for static website hosting.

##### Search Engine Optimisation and Site Performance Applications

- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). Website analytics are confusing, and we got to a point where the default tool (Google Analytics) was too complicated and not being utilised by clients. We started the search for better website analytics data, and landed on Plausible. The best way to describe Plausible is that it is a curated type of experience, showing you real statistics in a very tidy and easy to understand user interface. Fathom analytics is also worth a mention but for now we are sticking with Plausible.

- [Nightwatch](https://nightwatch.io/). Analytics do not track keyword ranking (SERP) so we need an additional application to monitor how your website is performing in organic search engine rankings. Whilst not completely sold on Nightwatch, it is what we are currently working with until something better comes along. The price seems to be reasonable in comparison to other SERP trackers.

- [Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/). Great little website that makes it quick and easy to identify your current website meta tags, and generate new ones. You can edit and experiment with your content then preview how your webpage will look on Google, Facebook, Twitter and more social networks.

- [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/tools/) and [Bing Places for Business](https://www.bingplaces.com/). One of the tools we don't have much of an option in using, as a website owner you need to utilise these systems to identify issues with crawling, and submit URLs for indexing in the Bing search engine.

- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and [Google Business](https://business.google.com/). Similar to it's Bing counterparts, we utilise these Google search tools to manage our search engine data in Google and identify areas of issue or improvement.

##### Office Software and Project Management Tools

- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). We switched to Todoist from Trello in mid-2021. Whilst already using Todoist for simple daily/weekly/monthly tasks, we decided to give it a spin for project management and collaborating with remote team members. Todoist does everything well on the whole, and believe it will get better over time to overtake Trello for project management.

- Proton replaced Google Workspace in our office around August 2020. We use [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for secure email communications, [ProtonDrive](https://drive.protonmail.com/) for end-to-end encrypted cloud storage, and [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) to test website geolocation functions along with search engine results from different locations.

- [Rounded](https://rounded.com.au/). Finding a suitable billing platform has been an ongoing journey. We started with Freshbooks back in the early days, and whilst it was simple it was also expensive with restrictions on client numbers. We tried MYOB and Quickbooks, and used Wave up until they stopped supporting businesses outside of North America in late 2019. Up until January 2022 we had been running a self-hosted install of InvoiceNinja but found it to be slow, often breaking after updates, and difficult to extract relevant financial information. Rounded is a wonderful invoicing platform, built in Australia for the Australian market, which helps with BAS reporting and has a very tidy user interface.

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Open source password manager that can be self-hosted on premise, and also offers some great features like sharing sensitive information with enterprise-grade security. We use Bitwarden as a simple password management tool, which is really useful along with their mobile application and browser extensions. Worth a try if you have a lot of logins that need to be as secure as possible.
