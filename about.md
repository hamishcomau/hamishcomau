## General Services and Company
Hamish has been building websites since 2001, from humble beginnings updating online property listings with an Auckland real estate agency, to managing teams of developers on extensive corporate projects. Delivering high quality and affordable web design, working with small local businesses, the development process is more than just a website to us. The Hamish studio is a full circle solution providing all the tools you need for success with your website and online sales.

### You seem new, how can I ensure that I won't get burned?
Hamish was founded in 2008, developing online solutions for local tour operators. Before that our director and lead developer started coding websites as a contractor whilst studying in 2001. We are located in a Burnie CBD studio, and currently employ four talented developers and copywriters.

### What type of service levels do you offer?
We stand by our attention to detail and rapid responses to support requests. If you submit a support request, we will respond within 2 business hours, and are open to discuss issues via email, phone, live chat, slack, Trello, or your preferred communication platform. You will be speaking to a senior developer at all times.

### Are you a good fit for my project?
Sometimes we are not best suited to achieve your desired goals or project specifications. The best way to move forward with your website is to have a chat with one of our developers, we value all enquiries - even those that we have to turn away or send to a better suited development studio.

### I don't have time to invest in my website. Can you create a brief and specifications?
Whilst we are adept at interpreting client desires into a beautiful website or well-planned marketing campaign, if you do not have time now, it generally translates to not having time down the line. We are happy to work with you, at your location, or meet regularly to relay the current project status.

### We need to talk with some references before signing up. Can I have a client list?
Unfortunately, due to privacy and signed NDA, we are not able to provide direct client contact information.

### Will your team be able to handle our needs?
Hamish has transparency at all levels, from developers to billing. If there are any potential additional charges or roadblocks, we will be upfront and honest about the challenges ahead. We currently have a reliable network of contacts who can step in to solve complications or introduce a different set of skills.

### Can you work with a company of our size or multiple levels of management and stakeholders?
The short answer is yes, we can work around or within your internal staff, or operate as an onsite contractor to ensure efficiency and reduce project crawl.

### Why should we pick Hamish over your competitors?
The core of our website design ethos is doing what is best for our clients. We fight for the best result, not the easiest, and can be downright stubborn when it comes to building out the right solution with our years of expertise. We are the best, and most qualified in Tasmania, with the results to prove it.
